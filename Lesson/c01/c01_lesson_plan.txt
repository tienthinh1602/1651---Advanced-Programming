procedural: php and database.php gets bigger and bigger
procedural to OOP: a house with different parts windows are made

independently doors are made independently walls, floors, lights...

programs are split into different parts working together.
Those are different objects

define an object: an apple, a motorbike, a cup, a light-bulb

*** "COMPARING 2 objects.png"
2 motorbikes on the road are 2 different objects classified by colour, size, speed
--> objects are differentiated by ID, attributes and actions

what do you need first to start building an object? -- a blueprint/ a design

*** CLASS_motorcycle_blueprint.jpg
-->class - a blueprint to build multiple houses



/**Motorbike1.java*/

instance variable - the attributes

methods - the actions

After the blueprint/design/class, we need a production line
to actually make an object
*** CONSTRUCTOR_motorcycle-factory-build.jpg
constructor (~production line: day chuyen san xuat -- show IMAGE)
    //constructor
    //A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
    //The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
    //It can be used to set initial values for object attributes

    //default constructor, automatically created if there is no constructor
	//parameterized constructor, manually created


/**TestSystem.java*/
main method to run program
demo and lead objects
lead.speed = 45; // this is not OOP

==>Motorbike2.java


/**Motorbike2.java*/

//instance variable - the attributes
//it should always be private
//what is private? public?
private double speed = 0.0f; //no initialization in constructors

getters & setters: Property


/**TestSystem.java*/
wave object
//toString method, if commented: sout memory location


/**Driver.java*/
how classes work together
/**TestSystem.java*/
